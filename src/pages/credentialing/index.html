            <p>
              ACSA-F (Autonomous Cloud &amp; Security Architect – Fellow) is a post-nominal designation awarded to Fellows
              who demonstrate architect-level capability across cloud architecture, automation, security-by-design,
              operational readiness, and AI governance — and successfully defend their work live.
            </p>
            <p class="muted">
              The designation is intentionally selective to preserve its meaning and employer trust.

              Fellows design and implement an enterprise-grade, secure, AI-enabled multi-tenant SaaS platform under assigned constraints
