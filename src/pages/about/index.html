            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
              To develop and certify cloud and security architects who can design, automate, and defend resilient cloud
              platforms in a world of accelerating complexity and expanding attack surface.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top:22px;">Vision</h2>
            <p>
              To become a trusted standard for modern cloud and security architecture — where credentials are earned
              through real builds, rigorous evaluation, and architecture defense.

          <h2>Why the Institute exists</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            Cloud architecture is becoming harder. AI expands both capability and attack surface. Tool knowledge alone is no longer enough.

            <h3>Complexity is increasing</h3>
            <p>
              Distributed systems, multi-account governance, container platforms, and hybrid environments require architectural discipline.
            </p>

            <h3>Attack surface is expanding</h3>
            <p>
              AI adoption accelerates integration and change velocity. Without security-first architecture, risk compounds quickly.

            <h3>Training is misaligned</h3>
            <p>
              Many programs teach tools or services. Few validate architectural reasoning, operational readiness, or defense capability.

    <!-- HOW WE CREDENTIAL -->

          <div>
            <h2>How credentialing works</h2>
            <p>
              Institute credentials are awarded based on demonstrated capability — not multiple-choice exams.
              Fellows are evaluated through real architecture builds and decision defense.
            </p>

            <p class="muted">
              The Institute’s approach is designed to scale without weakening standards. Rubrics define evaluation domains,
              and the ACSA-F designation is awarded only after capstone defense.
