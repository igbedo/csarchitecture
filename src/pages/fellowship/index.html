            <h2>From Cloud Engineer to Security-First Architect</h2>
            <p>
              Most engineers can deploy infrastructure. Few can design secure, automated platforms under real constraints
              and clearly defend tradeoffs in a review setting.
            </p>
            <p>
              This fellowship develops architects who can design for resilience, integrate security by architecture,
              automate delivery end-to-end, and operate with AI-assisted workflows built with guardrails.
